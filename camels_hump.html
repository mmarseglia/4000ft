These notes are written to help you compare the various routes that
are <I>commonly</I> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written on the
assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.

<P>You may want to look (in a separate window) at a <A TARGET = "_BLANK"
HREF="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=18&amp;n=4911181&amp;e=668731&amp;loc=Camels+Hump">Topozone
Map</A> of the area around Camels Hump.

<P>Camel's Hump (elevation 4,083 feet) is the highest undeveloped
mountain in Vermont, with no structures at the summit.  Its rocky
summit rises a few hundred feet above treeline, giving it an alpine
feel that is only found on it and on Mount Mansfield in Vermont.
Please protect the delicate alpine vegetation!

<P>The most common approaches to Camels Hump are fairly short trips
from either the east or the west, though a much longer approach from
the north is possible.  From either the east or the west there is a
choice of an up and down trip or a longer and more interesting loop.

<P>The direct way from the east is by the <B>Monroe Trail</B> to the
LT, then a short distance south on the LT to the summit (rt: 6.8
miles; 2,600 feet; 4:40).  A very popular alternative is to make a
loop, taking the <B>Dean Trail</B> where it branches off the Monroe
Trail to Wind Gap, then going north along the LT to the summit,
returning by the Monroe Trail (lp: 8.0 miles; 2,600 feet; 5:20).
There is a steep scramble going up to the summit by the LT, and at one
time it appears as if one will have to climb some very impressive
cliffs!  These cliffs are bypassed on the west.  It is possible to add
a mile and 30 minutes to either of these routes by following the LT
north of the summit beyond Gorham Lodge and then taking the <B>Alpine
Trail</B> back to the Monroe Trail.

<P>From the west the direct approach is by the <B>Burrow's Trail</B>
which joins the LT just north of the summit (rt: 4.8 miles; 2,300
feet; 3:30).  A longer and more interesting variation is to take a
short connector trail to the <B>Forest City Trail</B>, and follow that
trail to its junction with the LT at Wind Gap, then following the LT
to the summit.  Descend by going north on the LT to its junction with
the Burrow's Trail, and return by that trail (lp: 6.0 miles; 2,300
feet; 4:10).

<P>The longest approach is from the north, taking the LT south from
River Road to the summit (rt: 12.4 miles; 3,700 feet; 8:05).  This
large elevation gain is due to the very low elevation of the
trailhead, only 400 feet above sea level.  There are many good
viewpoints along the way, in addition to the views from the summit.
