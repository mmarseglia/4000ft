<h1>Forest Service Road Closures in New Hampshire</h1>
</div>  <!--  header div  -->

<div id="main">

<p>In winter many of the access roads we take for granted in warmer
weather are closed, making certain trips much longer. The time of
these road closures (and of their re-opening in spring) varies
according to conditions, and until recently the Forest Service did not
publish updated information on the status of these roads.  So for a
few years I collected information about road closures (in the winter)
and re-openings (in spring) from volunteers.</p>

<p>The Forest Service has finally put a <a
href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/white_mountain/recreation/roads_status.php">Forest
Road Status</a> page on their web site, and there is thus no longer
any need for an unofficial substitute.  Should they ever discontinue
that page I will be happy to resurect my version.</p>

<p>Let me end by thanking the many volunteers who, over the past few
winters and springs, have sent me their observations on which roads
were open and which were closed.  Without them this page would not
have existed!</p>


<p><b>Note on Mt. Clinton and Base Roads</b>: During the winter of
2004-5 the Cog Railway operated as a <a
href="http://www.mountwashingtoncograilwayskitrains.com/">ski
train</a>, and the Base Road was plowed to the Base Station.  Hikers
were allowed to park in the <i>lower</i> parking lot at the station,
the first one reached when driving in.  The traditional Forest Service
summer lot, before the Base Station, was unplowed and unused.  As a
result hikers could use the original Jewell and Ammonoosuc Ravine
trailheads at the station.  The Mt. Clinton Road was "closed" (but not
gated), and was unplowed and used as a snowmobile trail.  Hikers using
Edmands Path drove up the Base Road and parked at the four way
junction of the Base Road with the Mt. Clinton and Jefferson Notch
roads.  This made hikes up Mounts Monroe, Washington and Jefferson
much simpler than in previous years.</p>
