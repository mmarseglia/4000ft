I am not affiliated with the AMC 4000 Footer Committee in any way, the
following answers are simply my interpretation of what I have read in
various places.  The first question tells you where to go for official
answers!

</UL>

<A NAME = "lists0"></A><B>Q</B>. Where can I get official information
about the 4000 Footer Club?

<P><B>A</B>.  The 4000 Footer Club can be reached at:

<BR><BR>
Four Thousand Footer Committee,<BR>
42 Eastman Street,<BR>
Concord NH 03301.<BR>

<P>You can also <A HREF="mailto:gene-daniell@attbi.com">email</A> the
Committee (actually its Corresponding Secretary).  This email address
is included with his permission.

<P>If you write please enclose a self addressed stamped envelope.
Also note that if you just request the list you will only get the NH
4000 footer list.  Should you want the NE 4000 footer or NE 100
highest lists ask for them explicitly.

<P>The information packet sent to those who request the lists contains
a brief discussion of the rules and an application form, which
consists of a list of the peaks with spaces in which you record the
date climbed and any comments, such as companions.

<P>There is also a <A
HREF="http://www.outdoors.org/activities/hiking/hiking-4kfooter-club.shtml">web
site</A>, but currently it has almost no information other than the
list of New Hampshire 4000 footers and the mailing address given above.


<P><A NAME = "rules1"></A><B>Q</B>.  What are the rules for climbing
4000 footers?

<P><B>A</B>.  The basic rule is very simple: You must climb (on foot!)
to and from the summit of each peak on the list.  In winter skis and
snowshoes are both allowed.

<P>For peaks with trails starting at maintained roads the rule is
simple: Drive to the trailhead then walk (note that you are not
allowed to use the auto roads on Mts Washington, Mansfield and
Equinox).  For peaks in areas with rough logging roads you may drive
as far as you dare with a normal car (that includes four wheel drive),
but ATVs are not allowed.  See <A HREF="#lists6">below</A> for the
rules on using mountain bicycles.

<P>You are allowed to count any number of peaks on a single trip.

<P><A NAME = "rules2"></A><B>Q</B>.  How do I apply for membership?

<P><B>A</B>.  When you have finished a list fill out the
application form (either the paper one you received from the Committee
or the online one supplied here).  Precise dates of climbs are not
required, as many people decide to start recording their climbs long
after they have started climbing.  A precise date for the last climb
is very desirable, please mark your last climb on the list.  Also the
Committee requires an account of that last climb, or of any other
peak, or even an essay on any topic related to your 4,000 footer
experience.  In response to my question the Secretary wrote to me:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have never refused membership for lack of essay, but I still think
people ought to do it as it provides feedback to us.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The Secretary is a volunteer, active in many other areas of the
Club.  Please expect the processing of your application to take at
least two months!  Since the <A HREF="#rules3">awards ceremony</A> is
usually held in April it is a good idea for those who have finished
the list over the summer or fall to send their application in before
the end of the year.  Those doing the winter peaks will obviously send
their applications in later, but try to send it as soon as you have
finished.

<P>There is an application fee that covers the cost of the scroll, one
patch and postage.  The Committee asks that applicants voluntarily set
this fee at $8, but they do not want to deter anyone from membership
because of cost. Therefore the minimum fee required, which covers the
basic expenses is $5.  Also additional patches may be purchased for $3
each.  If you pay more than the required dues the balance goes into a
fund that contributes to trail maintenance, I strongly encourage you
to do so.

<P><A NAME = "rules3"></A><B>Q</B>.  When is the Awards Dinner?

<P><B>A</B>.  Usually in April, those applying for awards are notified
by mail, and it is listed in the <I>AMC Outdoors</I> magazine.  I try
to announce the date on the hiking bulletin boards.

<P><A NAME = "lists1"></A><B>Q</B>.  Where can I find the lists?

<P><B>A</B>.  Right <A HREF="lists.html">here</A>!  Note that the
Committee currently accepts applications printed directly from a
spreadsheet <B>if it is in the required format</B>.  I have included
spreadsheets that are acceptable to the Committee.  In fact I used
them for all my applications.

<P>As noted above the official web site currently only has the list of
NH Fours, it is not suitable for use as a spreadsheet.

<P><A NAME = "lists2"></A><B>Q</B>.  What are the recent changes to the lists?

<P><B>A</B>.  The lists are periodically revised to reflect the
information on the most current maps. As of April 2001 a few changes
have been made to the lists:

<UL>

<LI> For the NH Fours the "D" peak of Wildcat replaces the "E" peak.

<LI> For the NE Fours two peaks in Maine have been elevated to Four
Thousand Footer status, they are Redington and Spaulding.

<LI> For the NE Hundred Highest list three peaks have been removed,
and replaced by three new peaks.  The peaks removed are Middle
Abraham, Mahoosuc Arm and the North Peak of the Bigelow Horns, all in
Maine.  They have been replaced by The Bulge (NH), Cupsuptic Snow and
the North Peak of Kennebago Divide, both in Maine.  Note that there are
now two peaks in Maine named "Snow" on the Hundred Highest list.

</UL>

<P><A NAME = "lists3"></A><B>Q</B>.  Do all the 4,000 Footers have trails
to them?

<P><B>A</B>.  All of the Fours have trails to them.  In two cases the
trails are not officially maintained.  The first is Owl's Head, where
the path is unofficial but well described in the <I>White Mountain
Guide</I> and shown on all maps.  The second is Redington, and that
path, while clear, is not described in the current Maine Mountain
Guide, nor shown on current maps.  I have written a <A
HREF="reddington.html">description</A> of the path.

<P><A NAME = "lists4"></A><B>Q</B>.  Where can I find information on
the trail-less peaks on the Hundred Highest list?

<P><B>A</B>.A photocopied pamphlet describing routes to the trailless
peaks on the New England Hundred Highest list is available from the
Four Thousand Footer Committee for $3.  A set of black-and-white USGS
maps covering these peaks (printed out from Maptech CDs) is an
additional $2.  You can request them from:

<BR><BR>
Four Thousand Footer Committee,<BR>
42 Eastman Street,<BR>
Concord NH 03301.<BR>
<BR>

<P><A NAME = "lists5"></A><B>Q</B>.  When does winter start and end?

<P><B>A</B>.  Many hikers believe that winter starts on Dec
21<sup>st</sup> and ends on March 20<sup>th</sup>.  Things are not
quite so simple. The FTFC writes: <BLOCKQUOTE> Trips must begin after
the hour and the minute of the beginning of winter (winter solstice),
and end before the hour and minute of the end of winter (spring
equinox), to satisfy the criteria established by Miriam Underhill, the
inventor of the Winter Four-Thousand-Footer Game.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

In the US edition of her book, <I>Give me the Hills</I> Miriam
Underhill is even more specific, as she writes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This game was an offshoot, of course, of that very popular game of the
Appalachian Mountain Club, Climbing the Four-thousanders, which was
set in motion, and such vigorous and enthusiastic motion, in 1958.
Our game &mdash;"ours" because we were the first to play it&mdash;
followed right along.  As the initiators we set the rules, which
concerned the definition of "winter".  "Snow on the ground" and other
namby-pamby criteria definitely did not count.  "Winter" was to be
measured exclusively by the calendar.  In 1960, for instance, winter
began at 3:27 PM on Wednesday, December 21, too late to get up to Crag
Camp by daylight.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Notice the use of the word "game".  Games have rules, which may well
be arbitrary, but if you play a game you should follow the rules.  If
you do not like the rules, you are free to define your own game, but
must clearly differentiate it from the "official" game.  Also note the
last sentence of the quotation above.  The <I>entire trip</I> has to
start (and end) during winter.  She did not allow the trip up to Crag
Camp to start one day before winter, with the final ascent taking
place on the first day of winter.

<P>
The official times of the <A
HREF="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/EarthSeasons.html">Equinoxes
and Solstices</A> are available on the US Naval Observatory web site.
Note that the times are given in Universal Time (UT).  To convert to
EST subtract five hours.  The following table (using EST) is extracted
from that site:

<BR><BR>
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=3 CELLPADDING=3 ALIGN=CENTER>
<THEAD>
<TR><TD class=L>Winter of</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>Start</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>End</TD></TR>
</THEAD>
<TR><TD class=L>2001-2002</TD><TD>Dec. 21, 2:21 PM</TD><TD>Mar. 20, 2:16 PM</TD></TR>
<TR><TD class=L>2002-2003</TD><TD>Dec. 21, 8:14 PM</TD><TD>Mar. 20, 8:00 PM</TD></TR>
<TR><TD class=L>2003-2004</TD><TD>Dec. 22, 2:04 AM</TD><TD>Mar. 20, 1:45 AM</TD></TR>
<TR><TD class=L>2004-2005</TD><TD>Dec. 21, 7:42 AM</TD><TD>Mar. 20, 7:33 AM</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Note that while the first day of winter in 2001 and 2002 is
December 21<sup>st</sup> it occurs after dark in 2002, and less than
two hours before sunset in 2001.  So the first full hikable winter
day in 2001-2003 is Dec 22<sup>nd</sup>.  In 2004 December
21<sup>st</sup> is a full hiking day.

<P>Similarly, except in 2003, March 19<sup>th</sup> is the last full
hikable day of winter, as winter ends too early on the 20<sup>th</sup>
of other years to allow a full day of hiking.  It is possible, though,
to reach the trailhead from a hut (or a short hike) on that day in
2002, but not in 2004 or 2005.

<P><A NAME = "lists6"></A><B>Q</B>.  Can I use a mountain bike while
bagging a peak?

<P><B>A</B>.  Until recently the policy was not to allow them, but it
has recently changed.  In the document <I>Routes to New England
Hundred Highest Peaks</I> dated 1/1/02 the following paragraph
appears:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
MOUNTAIN BIKING: The increased popularity of mountain bikes apparently
makes it necessary to come up with some sort of policy.  Please
remember that this is a club for hikers; not that we object to trail
bikes <I>per se</I>, but we want to preserve the tradition of climbing
on foot, not on bikes.  In winter we have absolutely forbidden the use
of snowmobiles, even when a road is passable to ordinary cars in
summer.  However, a similar policy on trail bikes seems a bit
excessive.  Therefore I suggest that we all attempt to live by the
following standard:  it is acceptable to use bikes on logging roads
that are not part of officially maintained trails <B>if</B> the road
would be fairly easily passable to an average four-wheel-drive vehicle
(<B>not</B> an ATV) without "heroic measures" such as winches.  If you
think a jeep might not make it, then please walk.  If everyone can be
reasonable about self-enforcing this standard then I won't be forced
to come up with more excruciating technicalities.
