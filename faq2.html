This page answers many questions about doing a one day Presidential
Traverse and other big one day hikes in the White Mountains.  You may
also want to read about <A HREF="mytraverse.html">my Presi Traverse of
2001</A>.  There are also some notes on other "big hikes", the term
"Death March" is often used to describe them.

<P><A NAME = "presi1"></A><B>Q</B>.  What is a Presi Traverse?

<P><B>A</B>.  There is no official definition of a Presi Traverse (the
widely used shorthand for Presidential Range Traverse).  I define it
to be a one day traverse of most or all of the peaks of the
Presidential range which have trails.  It thus excludes John Quincy
Adams (though he was a president) and includes Clay and Franklin
(though neither was a president, and neither peak is an official 4,000
footer).

<P>The minimal traverse goes over Madison, Adams, Jefferson, Clay,
Washington, Monroe, Franklin, Eisenhower and Pierce.  Often Jackson is
added, more rarely Webster also.  Since my definition has nothing to
do with the names or elevations of the peaks, I believe that a full
traverse should include Jackson (named after the State geologist, not
the president!) and Webster.  Given the length of even the minimal
traverse it is understandable that many people are fully satisfied by
doing it.

<P>Most people do it from North to South, as this gets most of the
elevation gain, and most of the rock hopping, out of the way
relatively early.  The easiest way up Madison is by the Valley Way to
the hut, and then up and down the Osgood trail, but some prefer to
take the steeper and rougher Watson Path, traversing the summit of
Madison.  Beyond Madison there is no choice, the Gulfside is followed
to Washington, then the Crawford Path to its junction with the Webster
Cliff trail, taking all the loops over the summits.

<P>Those doing the minimal traverse then go up to the summit of Pierce
and return to the Crawford Path which they follow to the road.
Otherwise the Webster Cliff trail is followed, either just to Jackson
(exiting by the Jackson branch of the Webster-Jackson trail) or all
the way to Webster.  In the latter case there are two options, exit by
either the Webster branch of the Webster-Jackson trail, or continue on
the Webster Cliff trail to the road.


<P><A NAME = "presi2"></A><B>Q</B>.  How long is a Presi Traverse?

<P><B>A</B>.  The minimal traverse is 19.8 miles with 8,500 feet of
elevation gain.  The table below gives figures for the minimal
traverse and the more common extensions.

<P>A separate page gives the <A HREF="traverse_times.html">distances
and elevation gains</A> on the segments of the minimal traverse,
together with an Excel spreadsheet that you can modify.  You can also
read a trip report on my <A HREF="mytraverse2.html#trip">2001 Presi Traverse
attempt</A>.

<P><A NAME = "presi3"></A><B>Q</B>.  Where can I get water and food
during a Presi Traverse?

<P><B>A</B>.  The minimal traverse passes by Madison hut, the
Mt. Washington summit and Lakes of the Clouds hut, longer traverses
also pass by Mizpah hut.  Water can be obtained at all of these
locations.  Most people doing the traverse will reach Madison hut
before breakfast, so left over brownies will not be available.  It is
possible to eat a full lunch at the Mt Washington summit, and to buy
snacks at the remaining huts.

<P>The huts and summit must be used with discipline.  They greatly
diminish the amount of water that needs to be carried, but there is a
temptation to stay too long there.

<P><A NAME = "presi4"></A><B>Q</B>.  How long will it take to do a
Presi Traverse?

<P><B>A</B>.  This is difficult to predict, as for most people it is a
significantly longer trip than usual.  It is one thing to beat book
time on a ten mile and 3,000 foot day, quite another to even match
it on a twenty mile day with more than double the elevation gain!  I
would guess that hikers who normally beat book time by about 20%
should anticipate requiring at least full book time on a traverse.

<P>The good news is that, beyond Washington, there is no sustained
elevation gain, though late in the day even the 300 foot climbs
required to summit Monroe and Eisenhower seem long.  Also the Crawford
Path is a good smooth trail.

<P><A NAME = "presi5"></A><B>Q</B>.  How do I prepare for a Presi
Traverse?

<P><B>A</B>.  There are two components to preparing for a traverse:
endurance and climbing.  You should certainly do a few very long hikes
like the <A HREF="bondrts.html#Bonds">Bonds</A>, plus shorter hikes with
substantial elevation gain, like <A
HREF="npresi.html#MadAdams">Madison and Adams</A>.  If you live in the
Boston area the <A HREF="strenuous.html">Blue Hills</A> are a good
place in which to train when you cannot go up north.  Expect the
traverse to be tiring in spite of your training unless you are
exceptionally fit.  Read about how I <A
HREF="mytraverse.html#Training">trained</A> for my 2001 attempt.

<P><A NAME = "presi6"></A><B>Q</B>.  Logistics of a Presi Traverse?

<P><B>A</B>.  Ideally you should spend the night before and the night
after the traverse in northern New Hampshire.  Cars should be spotted
the night before and plans made for a very early start.  Most people
try to start some time between 4 and 5 AM.  You may want to read <A
HREF="mytraverse.html#Logistics">how we did it</A>.


<P>As a minimum you need one car at the end of the traverse, and a
second one to take you to the start.  If more cars are available it is
a very good idea to leave one at the Cog Railway base station, this
will allow you to bail out by either the Jewell or Ammonoosuc Ravine
trails in case of bad weather or fatigue.  If planning to exit by the
Webster Cliff trail a car should be left at the Crawford trailhead,
that allows you to bail out at Pierce or Jackson.


<P><A NAME = "presi6a"></A><B>Q</B>.  When do people do a Presi
Traverse?

<P><B>A</B>.  The most popular day is the Saturday closest to the
Summer Solstice, to get as much daylight as possible.  All you really
need, of course, is a long day.  Checking the times of <A
HREF="sun_nh_2001.html">sunrise and sunset</A> shows that there are
more than 15 hours of sunlight from some time in late May until some
time in late July.  That is only 30 minutes less than the longest day,
and probably makes little real difference.

<P>Since Mud Season, which makes serious training on the trails rather
difficult, often lasts until Memorial Day I prefer to do it later
rather than sooner within that window.

<P><A NAME = "presi7"></A><B>Q</B>.  What is a moonlight Presi
Traverse?

<P><B>A</B>.  You select a night with a full (or almost full) moon and
pray for good weather.  Usually you start from Appalachia early enough
to get to the summit of Madison by sunset, then you go over the ridge,
celebrating sunrise on Washington or Monroe.

<P>With good weather this can be a magic experience, but given the
unpredictability of weather in the Presidentials it is a high risk trip.
