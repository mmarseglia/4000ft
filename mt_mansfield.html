These notes are written to help you compare the various routes that
are <I>commonly</I> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written on the
assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.

<P>You may want to look (in a separate window) at a <A
HREF="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=44.54361&amp;lon=-72.81472&amp;loc=Mount+Mansfield">Topozone
Map</A> of the Mount Mansfield area.

<P>Mount Mansfield (elevation 4,393 feet) is the highest mountain in
Vermont.  From the east its ridge resembles the profile of a human
face, and the names of its prominent features reflect this: Adams
Apple (4,060'), Chin (4,393', highest point), Nose (4,062') and
Forehead (3,940').  For about 2.3 miles (from the Forehead to Adams
Apple) the Long Trail is almost constantly above treeline, the only
such long stretch of alpine zone in Vermont.  Please stay on the trail
to avoid harming the delicate vegetation!  As the <I>Long Trail
Guide</I> writes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mount Mansfield is the most frequently visited mountain in Vermont
with nearly 40,000 visitors walking its upper reaches every year.
This use has severely affected its fragile ecosystem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There are very many trails up Mt. Mansfield, I will describe a few
of the more popular routes.  Many of the routes that are not described
here are very steep and exposed.

<P>The classic loop goes up by the Long Trail from Smuggler's Notch
(on VT 108, east of the mountain), past Taft Lodge, to the col (Eagle
Pass) between the Chin and the Nose.  There is a section with steep
ledges between the Chin and Eagle Pass, I prefer to go up it than
down!  Follow the ridge for about 2 miles to the Summit Station at the
base of the Nose.  Descend a short distance on the Toll Road, then
take the <B>Haselton Trail</B> to the base of the mountain on VT 108, about a
mile south of where you started (lp: 6.5 miles; 2,800 feet; 4:40).
Note that the entire ridge is very exposed to the elements.

<P>In bad weather it is much preferable to avoid the loop and just go
up and back on the Long Trail (rt: 4.6 miles; 2,800 feet; 3:40).  The
amount of exposure can be further reduced by going from Taft Lodge to
the Chin by the very steep, but sheltered, <B>Profanity Trail</B> (same
distance and elevation gain).

<P>A much steeper and rougher approach from the north is by the
<B>Hell Brook Trail</B>.  This trail meets the LT in Eagle Pass, 0.3
mile north of the summit.  It is recommended to descend by the LT (lp:
4.1 miles; 2,600 feet; 3:20).

<P>Another popular approach is from Underhill State Park to the west
of the mountain.  The scenic route is the <B>Sunset Ridge Trail</B>,
which follows the Sunset Ridge above treeline for almost a mile (rt:
6.6 miles; 2,700 feet; 4:40).  You can make a loop back to the same
trailhead by following the <B>Laura Coles Trail</B> (6.0 miles; 2,700 feet;
4:20).
