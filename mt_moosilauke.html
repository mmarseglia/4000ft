<h1>Hiking Mount Moosilauke, New Hampshire</h1>

These notes are written to help you compare the various routes that
are <I>commonly</I> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written on the
assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.

<H2>Online Map</H2>

<p>If you do not have a printed map handy you may want to look at a
TopoZone map of <A TARGET = "_BLANK" HREF =
"http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=44.02444&amp;lon=-71.83139">Mount
Moosilauke</A> (elevation 4,802 feet) in a separate window while
reading the text.  The main trails are marked, but not labelled.


<P>Mt. Moosilauke is the most westerly of the New Hampshire Fours.  In
good weather you get great views to the west into Vermont and New York
from its bare summit.

<H2>Trails</H2>

<B>Gorge Brook</B> trail, starting at the Ravine Lodge, is probably
the most popular trail on Mount Moosilauke (rt: 7.4 miles, 2,450 feet,
4:55).  Since Ravine Lodge is the highest trailhead on the mountain,
this is the trail with the least elevation gain.  It has been
relocated recently to avoid the steepest parts of the old trail, and
is now relatively easy.

<P>The <B>Beaver Brook</B> trail, though equally short (rt: 7.6 miles,
3,100 feet, 5:20), has an extremely steep and rough section along the
beautiful cascades.  This section can be slippery when wet or icy.

<P>The <B>Glencliff trail</B> joins the Carriage Road at the base of
the South Peak (which has attractive views) and uses the last 0.9 mile
of that trail to reach the summit (rt: 7.8 miles, 3,300 feet, 5:30),
it has good footing and only one steep section.

<P>The <B>Moosilauke Carriage Road</B> is wide and has good footing
most of the way, it also has the gentlest grades of any trail on this
mountain (rt: 10.2 miles, 3100 feet, 6:40).

<P>Finally the <B>Benton Trail</B> (rt: 7.2 miles, 3,100 feet, 5:10) has
moderate grades and good footing, but a stream crossing near the start
may be difficult at high water.

<P>With all these trails a variety of loops are possible.  With one car
there are two possible loops starting and ending at the Ravine lodge.
Go up Gorge Brook trail, and descend by either the Carriage Road and
Snapper trail (lp: 7.5 miles, 2,450 feet, 5:00) or by the Beaver Brook
and Asquam Ridge trails (lp: 9.6 miles, 2,450 feet, 6:00).  A long
loop recommended in the <I>White Mountain Guide</I> uses the Benton,
Glencliff and Tunnel Brook trails (lp: 13.3 miles, 3,100 feet, 8:10).
With two cars it is possible to go up by the very steep Beaver Brook
trail and return by either the Gorge Brook (lp: 7.5 miles, 3,100 feet,
5:20) or Glencliff (lp: 7.7 miles, 3,100 feet, 5;25).
 
<P>To summarize, here are the distances, elevation gains and book times
of the various possible routes up Mt. Moosilauke:
