This description of my 2001 attempt at a Presi Traverse is a
supplement to the discussion in the <A HREF="faq2.html">Presi
Traverse FAQ</A>.  I hope it will make the issues discussed there
come to life.

<A NAME = "Training"></A><H2><A NAME="tocref1"></A>Training</H2>

<P>I try to hike two or three days a week, both in the <A
HREF="strenuous.html">Boston area</A> and in the White Mountains.  I
try to do one strenuous hike each week, either a long hike, or one
with substantial elevation gain, or a shorter hike done fast
(relative to my usual times!).  I use my altimeter constantly when
hiking, computing average rate of elevation gain (feet per hour),
which I find to be a better indicator than speed (miles per hour).

<P>The traverse was scheduled for around June
20<SUP>th</SUP> (subject to weather forecasts, we did
it on the 25<SUP>th</SUP>), and in early June I started
pushing myself harder:

<UL> 

<LI><I>June 6<SUP>th</SUP></I>.  I did the <A
HREF="bondrts.html#Bonds">Three Bonds in a Day</A> traverse from Zealand
to Lincoln Woods as part of a group.  This is about 20 miles with
under 4,000 feet of elevation gain, it was mainly a test of long
distance stamina.

<LI><I>June 11<SUP>th</SUP></I>.  This and the next two
hikes, all in the Northern Presis, were done solo.  This time I went
up the Valley Way to the hut, then up to Madison and back to the hut,
then on to Adams and down by Lowe's Path and connecting trails to
Appalachia.

<LI><I>June 14<SUP>th</SUP></I>.  Back up to Madison
Hut by the Valley Way, then along the Gulfside Trail to the Israel
Ridge trail, which I followed down to the Perch, back by Randolph Path
and connecting trails.

<LI><I>June 17<SUP>th</SUP></I>.  This time I climbed
Madison by Howker Ridge, and descended from the hut by the Valley
Way.

</UL>

<P>I chose to do three hikes in the Northern Presis because I have
always had difficulty going down the piles of rock that are so
frequent in that area.  Clearly practice led to some improvement, but
it was clear that I would slow down significantly on several sections.

<P>After the 17<SUP>th</SUP> I stopped doing anything
strenuous until the traverse, to allow my body to recover from what
had clearly been excessive training.  For me four big hikes over
twelve days is definitely pushing it!

<A NAME = "Logistics"></A><H2><A NAME="tocref2"></A>Logistics</H2>

Chris asked me to join a group of his friends on a traverse, they did
most of the planning.  Chris and I met at Crawford on Sunday PM, the
day before the traverse.  We left my car there, and drove to Gorham.
We had been thinking of staying in the bunk room at the <A
HREF="http://www.hikersparadise.com/">Hiker's Paradise</A>, but since
we wanted to go to sleep early and wake at the crack of dawn we
decided to stay in their motel rooms.  We asked when the neighboring
convenience store opened in the morning, and to our delight were told
that it was a 24 hour store.

<P>We woke a bit before 4 AM, got coffee at the convenience store, ate
some bagels and muffins, and drove to the trailhead, ready to hike at
4:45.  Sleeping 15 minutes from the trailhead is a <I>big</I> win!

<A NAME = "Gear"></A><H2><A NAME="tocref3"></A>Food and Gear</H2>

We had decided that we were not going to eat at the summit of
Mt. Washington, as experience has shown that this can consume too much
time.  So in addition to snacks (lots of gorp, one apple, candy for
instant sugar) I brought a couple of bagels and most of a stick of
cheddar.

<P>I brought three quart water bottles.  Since Madison Hut is less
than four miles from the trailhead I only filled one before starting,
refilling it and filling the other two there.  This saved about four
pounds on the climb to the hut, which is about 40% of the total
elevation gain.  The three litres lasted comfortably until Lakes,
where we refilled again.  I drank about four liters on the entire
trip, others drank closer to six liters.

<P>I used my heavy <A HREF="http://www.limmerboot.com/home.htm">Limmer
boots</A>.  Many people prefer to use something lighter for such a
long day, but I feel that I need the sturdiest boots I own for the
rough terrain.  This is very much a matter of personal opinion.

<P>I always pack for the worst possible weather when planning a trip
with a lot of time above treeline.  So I packed polypro top and
bottom, fleece gloves, hat and jacket, Goretex top and bottom, and a
light weight wind jacket.


<P><B>Comments or Suggestions?</B> Did <I>you</I> attempt a Presi
traverse, or do you have any comments to make?  That is what the <A
