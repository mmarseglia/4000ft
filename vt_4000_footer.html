The five Vermont 4,000 footers are all on the Long Trail (LT), and close
enough to the roads that they can all be easily done as day trips.
Mounts Ellen and Abraham are often combined in a single hike over both
summits, while the other three are almost always done separately.

<P>

These notes are written to help you compare the various routes that
are <I>commonly</I> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written on the
assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.

<H2><A NAME="tocref1"></A>Killington Peak</H2>

If you do not have a printed map handy, you may want to look (in a
separate window) at a <A TARGET = "_BLANK"
HREF="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=18&amp;n=4833925&amp;e=671759">Topozone
map</A> of the area.

<P>There are two common approaches to Killington.  The shorter (rt:
7.2 miles; 2,500 feet; 4:50) is from the West, from Brewer's Corner,
and follows the <B>Bucklin Trail</B> to its junction with the Long Trail near
Cooper Lodge.  From here the Killington Spur climbs steeply to the
summit.

<P>A longer approach, doing both Killington and Pico Peak (elevation
3,957 feet,a peak on the <A HREF="hundred.html">New England 100
Highest list</A>), is from Sherburne Pass on Rt 4.  Take the old route
of the LT (now called the <B>Sherburne Trail</B>) to Pico Camp, then
up and down the <B>Pico Spur</B>, then continue on the LT to Cooper
Lodge, and go up and down the <B>Killington Spur</B>.  With only one
car you have to return the same way (rt: 12.0 miles; 2,650 feet;
7:20), with two cars you can descend by the Bucklin trail (lp: 9.6
miles, 2,650 feet, 6:10).

If you do not have a printed map handy, you may want to look (in a
separate window) at a <A TARGET = "_BLANK"
HREF="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=18&amp;n=4891511&amp;e=665543&amp;size=m">Topozone
map</A> of the area.

<P>These two summits are 3.7 miles apart on the "Monroe Skyline" section
of the LT.  They are close enough to be done together, though they
can, of course, be done separately.  They can be approached from where
the AT crosses roads in Lincoln Gap (south of Mt. Abraham) or
Appalachian Gap (north of Mt. Ellen), or from side trails on the west
slopes of the mountains.  When doing one peak alone it is usual do do
a round trip, there is little reason to use two trails and do a car
spot.  Doing both together requires two cars or the willingness to
thumb a rids back!

<P>The summit of Mount Abraham is one of the three areas in Vermont
with alpine vegetation, so please be careful!  The other two are Camels
Hump and Mount Mansfield.

<H3><A NAME="tocref3"></A>Mt. Abraham Alone</H3>

Mount Abraham can be done alone in two ways, both quite short.  It may
be approached from Lincoln Gap (elevation 2,424 feet) along the LT
(rt: 5.2 miles; 1,600 feet; 3:25), note that the road through Lincoln
Gap is not plowed in winter.  An approach with more elevation gain
uses the <B>Battell Trail</B> then the LT (rt: 5.8 miles; 2,500 feet;
4:10).

<H3><A NAME="tocref4"></A>Mt. Ellen Alone</H3>

Mount Ellen can also be approached via the LT from Appalachian Gap
(elevation 2,365 feet), but this route involves more elevation gain
than the trailhead elevation suggests, as it goes over General Stark
Mountain, then drops to the Glen Ellen Lodge before climbing up to
Mount Ellen (rt: 10.6 miles; 2,200 feet; 6:25).  Alternately it can be
approached via the <B>Jerusalem Trail</B> (rt: 8.6 miles; 2,600 feet;
5:35).

<H3><A NAME="tocref5"></A>Mt. Abraham and Mt. Ellen</H3>

Doing both peaks will give you the opportunity to do part or all of
the Monroe Skyline along the ridge.  To quote the <I>Hiker's Guide to
the Mountains of Vermont</I>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Although the ridge is generally densely wooded, the trail itself is
challenging, and there are enough viewpoints to make this a very
worthwhile excursion.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>With four trailheads there are a large number of potential routes, I
will describe a few of them.  All require two cars or the willingness
to thumb a ride back to the starting point.

<P>The most obvious way is to follow the LT from Lincoln to Appalachian
Gaps (lp: 11.6 miles; 2,500 feet; 7:00, same in reverse direction).
This goes over both peaks, plus Lincoln Peak and General Stark
Mountain.

<P>Another way is to start from Lincoln Gap but use the Jerusalem
Trail to go down (lp: 10.5 miles; 2,300 feet; 6:25), avoiding the
rather rough climb over General Stark Mountain.  Starting at
Appalachian Gap and exiting by the Battell Trail is another possibility
(lp: 11.8 miles; 2,500 feet; 7:10).

<P>Note that in all cases I suggest starting at one of the gaps, this
saves about 1,000 feet of elevation gain!

<H2><A NAME="tocref8"></A>Resources</H2>

The official guidebook is the <I>Long Trail Guide</I> published by the
Green Mountain Club (GMC).  This is a much less detailed guide than
the <I>White Mountain Guide</I>, and does not give the elevations of
trailheads.  The maps that come with it are not very detailed, though
there is a more detailed map of Mount Mansfield and Camels Hump.  Map
Adventures publishes a pair of maps that are a very useful supplement
to those in the guide.  The first is the <I>Northern Vermont Hiking
Trails</I>, which covers Mt. Mansfield, Camel's Hump and more.
The second is <I>Vermont and New Hampshire Hiking</I>, which covers
Killington, Abraham and Ellen, as well as other areas.  The GMC also
publishes a <I>Trail Map of Mt. Mansfield</I> separate from the
guidebook.

<P>All the Vermont Fours are covered in the <I>Long Trail Guide</I>,
but several of the peaks on the NE 100 Highest list are not.  These
will be found described in the <I>Day Hiker's Guide to Vermont</I>,
also published by the GMC.

<P>In addition to the two official guidebooks there are a large number
of other books, the one I use is the <I>Hiker's Guide to the Mountains
of Vermont</I> by Jared Gange, a slim volume that covers most of the
routes described here.
